 * We try to choose a `delta` that satisfies the constraints on the number
 * of anchor points in `num_anchors`. A naive approach would be to simply divide the
 * range of `x` by `num_anchors - 1`. However, this may place anchor points inside 
 * large gaps on the x-axis intervals where there are no actual observations. 
 * 
 * Instead, we try to distribute the anchor points so that they don't fall
 * inside such large gaps. We do so by looking at the largest gaps and seeing
 * what happens if we were to shift the anchor points to avoid such gaps. If we
 * jump across a gap, though, we need to "use up" a anchor point to restart
 * the sequence of anchor points on the other side of the gap. This requires some
 * iteration to find the compromise that minimizes the 'delta' (and thus the 
 * degree of approximation in the final lowess calculation).
